## Dataset Structure

The system uses a preprocessed CSV dataset with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `renter_id` | Unique identifier |
| `name` | Renter name |
| `email` | Contact email |
| `phone` | Contact phone |
| `current_rent` | Monthly rent amount |
| `months_as_renter` | Duration as renter |
| `income` | Annual income |
| `savings` | Total savings |
| `debts` | Total debts |
| `employment_years` | Years of employment |
| `credit_score_initial` | Starting credit score |
| `credit_score_current` | Current credit score |
| `payment_reliability_percent` | Percentage of on-time payments |
| `readiness_score` | Calculated readiness score (0-100) |
| `recommendation` | Ready Now / High Priority / Needs Improvement |

## Readiness Score Algorithm

The readiness score (0-100) is calculated based on:

- **Credit Score (30 points)**: Current credit score strength
- **Payment Reliability (25 points)**: Rental payment consistency
- **Savings Adequacy (20 points)**: Available funds for down payment
- **Employment Stability (10 points)**: Years of steady employment
- **Debt Management (10 points)**: Debt-to-income ratio
- **Credit Improvement (5 points)**: Credit score growth over time

## Readiness Categories

- **Ready Now (90-100)**: Qualified for immediate homeownership
- **High Priority (80-89)**: Nearly ready with minor improvements needed
- **Moderate (70-79)**: On track but needs focused preparation
- **Needs Improvement (<70)**: Requires significant financial improvement

## Usage Examples

### Python Analysis
```python
from rental_analysis import RentalToOwnerAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = RentalToOwnerAnalyzer('rental_data.csv')

# Get top prospects
top_prospects = analyzer.identify_top_prospects(10)

# Generate outreach messages
messages = analyzer.generate_outreach_messages()

# Create visualizations
analyzer.create_visualizations()
```

### React Dashboard
The included React component provides an interactive dashboard for:
- Filtering and sorting renters
- Viewing detailed financial profiles
- Tracking credit score improvements
- Generating personalized outreach messages
